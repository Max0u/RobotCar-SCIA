    Acceleromètre

Returns acceleration along each axis (x, y, z).

Goals:
    Compute position and speed using acceleration and integrals.

Position is placed in a 3D space with its origin the first location
of the car. Draw successive position using points or arrows.

Roads is placed successively around the position of the car.
Each pair of line roads is drawn after finding next points and
trying to join them.

Ex:

(0, 0, 0) to (1, 0, 0)
Road width is considered equal to 2 x w.
First line goes from (0, w, 0) to (1, w, 0).
Second line goes from (0, -w, 0) to (1, -w, 0).

In the first version of the program, coordinate z should be ignored
to only consider a 2D map.

On the IronCar map, Width is approximatively 1,5m.
Thus we take w = 0,75.

The car will not always be in the center of the road. So basic
image processing is still necesary to get the distance from the
center of the road of the car.
